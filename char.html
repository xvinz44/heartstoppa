They meet for the first time at the start of the series, having not spoken previously due to their age gap and different social circles. However, Nick's reputation precedes him as the standout star of the school's rugby team, with a promising sporting future ahead of him. He quickly becomes fond of Charlie after getting to know him in form, but the strength of his feelings forces him to address some tough personal questions.",
            "Tao is one of Charlie's best friends and is fiercely protective of him. He is highly skeptical when Nick starts spending time with Charlie and fears he could be taking advantage of his good nature. Generally, Tao is easily alarmed by anything that threatens to endanger the friendship group he loves so dearly, which also includes a newly absent Elle and Isaac.",

This term, she is starting at a neighboring all-girls school, but worries whether she will be able to make friends.",
